# TruthTable

I undertook the task of developing a Truth Table calculator as my project for the "Introduction to Discrete Structures" course (CISC.2210-TR2). Despite having no prior experience in Javascript or website development, I was able to complete the project within a month.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in using Javascript, as well as advanced HTML and CSS. To ensure the accuracy of the Truth Table calculator, I conducted extensive research and acquired in-depth knowledge of truth tables. While there are some known bugs and limitations, I plan to address and improve them in the future.

My project received a grade of 100, accounting 15% of my final grade, which was only awarded to those "whose projects were deemed outstanding."
